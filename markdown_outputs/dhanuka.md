We  have audited the accompanying  standalone quarterly financial results of  Dhanuka  Agritech Limited ('the Company')  for  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2025  and  the  year  to  date  results  for  the  period  from  April 1, 2024  to  March  31,  2025 ('the Statement'),  attached  herewith, being  submitted  by  the  Company  pursuant to the  requirement  of  Regulation  33  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Listing  Obligations  and Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015,  as  amended  ('Listing  Regulations').

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us these standalone  financial results:

- i. are presented  in accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Regulation  33  of  the  Listing  Regulations  in this regard; and
- ii, give  atrue  and  fair  view  in  conformity  with  the  recognition  and  measurement  principles  laid  down in the  applicable  Indian  Accounting  Standards  and  other  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in India,  of  the  net  profit and  other  comprehensive  income  and  other  financial information  for  the quarter  ended  March 31, 2025  as  well as year  to  date results  for  the  period from  April 1, 2024  to March  31, 2025.

## Basis  for  Opinion

We  conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing  (SAs) specifted under Section 143(10)  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013 (the  Act). Our  responsibilities  under  those  SAs  are  further  described in the Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Standalone Financial  Results section  of  our  report. We  are independent  of  the  Company, in accordance  with the Code of  Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants  of  India  together  with  the  ethical  requirements  that  are  relevant  to  our  audit  of  the financial results  under  the  provisions  of the Companies  Act,  2013  and  the Rules  thereunder,  and  we  have fulfilled our  other  ethical responsibilities in accordance  with  these  requirements  and  the  Code  of  Ethics. We  believe  that  the audit evidence  we  have  obtained is sufficient and appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for our  opinion.

This  Statement  has  been  prepared  on  the  basis  of  the  standalone  financial statements.

The  Company's  Board  of  Directors  are  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  these  financial  results  that  give a true and fair view  of  the  net profit  and other  comprehensive  income  and  other  financial information  in accordance  with  the  recognition  and  measurement  principles  laid down in Indian Accounting  Standards prescribed under Section 133 of  the Act  read with relevant  rules issued thereunder  and  other  accounting principles generally accepted in India  and in compliance  with Regulation 33 of  the Listing  Regulations. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of  the Act  for safeguarding of  the assets of the Company  and  for preventing  and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments  and  estimates  that  are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation  and  maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of  the accounting  records, relevant to the preparation  and presentation of  the standalone financial results that give a true and fair vicw  and are free from material misstatement,  whether  due  to fraud or  error.

In preparing the standalone financial results, the Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's  ability  to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern  and using  the going  concern  basis  of  accounting  unless  the  Board  of  Directors either intends  to liquidate  the  Company  or  to  cease  operations,  or  has  no  realistic  alternative  but  to  do  so.

The  Board  of  Directors  are  also  responsible  for  overseeing  the  Company's  financial reporting  process.

## Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Standalone  Financial  Results

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the standalone financial results as a whole  are  free  from  material misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an auditor's  report that includes  our opinion. Reasonable  assurance  is  a high level of  assurance, but is not a guarantee  that an audit conducted in accordance  with SAs  will always detect a material misstatement  when it exists. Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and are considered  material if, individually or in aggregate, they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of these standalone  financial  results.

As  part  of  an  audit  in accordance  with  SAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional skepticism  throughout  the  audit.  We  also:

- Â¢ Identify  and  assess  the  risks of  matcrial misstatement  of  the  standalone  financial results, whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence  that  is sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting a material  misstatement  resulting  from  fraud is higher  than  for one  resulting  from error, as fraud  may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Â¢ Obtain  an understanding  of  internal control relevant  to the audit in order  to design audit procedures that are appropriate  in  the circumstances,  Under  Section 143(3)(i)  of  the  Act, we  are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether  the Company  has adequate internal financial control with reference  to  financial statements  in  place  and  the  operating  effectiveness  of  such  controls.
- Evaluate   the the   reasonableness of accounting

<!-- image -->

estimates  and  related  disclosures  made  by  the  Board  of  Directors.

- e Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting  and,  based on  the audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material uncertainty  exists  related  to events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the  Company's  ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude  that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw  attention in our auditor's  report  to  the  related disclosures  in  the  financial results  or, if such  disclosures  are  inadequate, to modify  our  opinion. Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our auditor's  report.  However,  future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to  cease  to  continue  as a going  concern.
- e Evaluate  the overall presentation, structure and content of  the Statement, including  the disclosures, and  whether  the Statement  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and  events in a manner  that  achieves fair  presentation.

We  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance  regarding,  among  other  matters,  the  planned  scope and timing of  the audit and significant audit findings, including  any significant  deficiencies in internal control  that  we  identify  during  our  audit.

We  also provide  those charged  with governance  with a statement  that  we have  complied  with relevant ethical requirements  regarding  independence,  and  to  communicate  with  them  all  relationships  and  other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

## Other  Matters

The Statement includes the results for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 being the balancing figure between  the  audited  figures  in  respect  of  the  full financial  year  ended  March  31,  2025 and the  published unaudited  year  -to-date  figures  up  to  the  third  quarter  of  the  current  financial  year,  which were  subject  to a limited review  by  us, as required under  the  Listing  Regulations.

## Management's  Responsibilities  for  the  Consolidated  Financial  Results

The Holding  Company's  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  are  responsible  for  the  preparation and presentation  of  these  consolidated financial results that give a true and  fair  view of  the net  profit  and other comprehensive income and other financial information of the Group in accordance with, the applicable accounting  standards prescribed under Section 133 of  the Act  read with relevant rules issued thereunder  and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance  with Regulation 33 of  the Listing Regulations,

The  respective  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  of  the  companies  included  in  the  Group,  are  responsible  for maintenance  of  adequate  accounting  records in accordance  with the provisions  of  the Act, for safeguarding  of the assets  of  the  Group  and  for  preventing  and  detecting  frauds  and other  irregularities;  selection  and  application of  appropriate  accounting  policies; making judgments and estimates  that  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  and  design, implementation and maintenance  of  adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively, for ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  accounting  records, relevant  to  the preparation and  presentation of  the financial results, that give a true and fair view  and are free from material misstatement,  whether  due  to fraud or error which have  been used for the purpose  of  preparation  of  the Statement  by  the Directors of  the Holding  Company,  as  aforesaid.

In preparing  the Statement,  the respective Management  and  Board of  Directors of  the companies  included  in the Group  are  responsible  for  assessing  the  ability  of  the Group  to  continue  as  a  going  concern, disclosing,  as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the respective Board  of  Directors either intends  to liquidate the Group  or  to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative  but  to  do  so.

## Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Results

Our  objectives are to obtain reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated financial results as a whole are free  from material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  and  to issue  an auditor's  report  that  includes our  opinion. Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high level of  assurance, but  is not a guarantee  that  an audit  conducted  in accordance  with SAs  will always  detect  a material misstatement  when it exists. Misstatements  can  arise  from fraud  or  error  and are considered  material if, individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected to influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken on the basis  of the Statement.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism  throughout  the  audit. We  also:

- evidence that is sufficient anamnnpriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a e Identify  and assess  the  risks  of  material misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  results,  whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit

material misstatement  resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of internal  control.

- e Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control relevant  to  the  audit  in order  to design  audit  procedures  that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under  Section 143(3) (i) of  the Act, we  are also responsible  for expressing  our  opinion  on  whether  the  company  has  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to financial statements  in place and  the operating  effectiveness  of  such  controls,
- e Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates and  related  disclosures  made  by  the  Management  and  Board  of  Directors.
- e Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  Board  of  Directors' use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether  a  material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions  that  may cast significant  doubt  on  the  ability of  the Group  to  continue  as  a  going  concern. If we  conclude  that  a material uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw attention in our  auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial results or, if such disclosures are inadequate,  to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of  our auditor's report. However,  future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the Group  to cease  to continue  as  a going  concern,
- e Evaluate  the  overall presentation, structure and content  of  the consolidated financial results, including the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  consolidated  financial  results  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and events  in  a  manner  that  achieves  fair  presentation.
- e Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial results of  the entities within the Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  Financial  Results.  We  are  responsible  for  the  direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial information of such entities included in the consolidated  financial results of  which  we  are  the independent  auditors.. We  remain  solely  responsible for  our  audit  opinion. Our  responsibilities in this regard  are  further  described in the section  titled 'Other Matters'  in  this  audit  report.

We  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance  of  the  Holding  Company  and  such  other  entities included  in  the  consolidated  annual  financial results of  which we  are  the independent  auditors  regarding, among  other  matters,  the  planned scope  and  timing  of  the  audit  and significant  audit  findings, including any significant  deficiencies  in internal control  that  we identify. during  our  audit.

We  also provide  those  charged  with governance  with a statement  that we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical requirements  regarding independence,  and  to  communicate  with  them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our  independence,  and  where  applicable,  related  safeguards.
